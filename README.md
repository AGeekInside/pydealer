PyDeck
=============================

A module containing a class/methods for generating/shuffling/dealing any number of decks of 52 playing cards (standard 'French deck'). Possibly could be used for a command prompt/console (not a video game console), card-based game.

**[See a demo.](http://repl.it/MVy)**

**Features:**

- Generates a standard 'French deck' of 52 playing cards.
- Can shuffle the deck.
- Can deal a specified number of cards from the deck.
    - At the moment, when the deck runs out of cards PyDeck just generates a new deck, shuffles, and continues on. Probably make that togglable at some point.
- Each card is it's own object, with a name, abbreviation, and value.
